# Query Berachain Data with Pyth Oracles

[Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/) is a decentralized oracle network that provides high-quality, real-time data for Berachain. This repo provides an example of how to query Pyth Network data on Berachain's Artio Testnet.

Pyth differs from the existing oracle paradigm by using on-demand price updates, where users pull on-chain prices only when neededâ€Š- learn more [here](https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-a-new-model-to-the-price-oracle).

## Requirements

- Nodejs `v20.11.0` or greater
- pnpm (or another prefered package manager)
- Wallet with testnet $BERA tokens - See the [Berachain Artio Faucet](https://artio.faucet.berachain.com)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) - ensure `foundryup` is run to install binaries

## Quick Setup

### Step 1 - Setup Project & Install Dependencies

```bash
# FROM: ./pyth-oracle
forge init;

pnpm install;
pnpm install @pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity;
```

Add the following line to `./foundry.toml`:

```toml
remappings = ['@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/=node_modules/@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity']
```

### Step 2 - Set up for Deployment

Run the following to import your wallet's private key into Foundry's keystore (with the `deployer` alias):

```bash
cast wallet import deployer --interactive;
```

Confirm that your wallet was imported by running:

```bash
cast wallet list;

# [Example output]
# deployer (Local)
```

Load the Berachain RPC into your terminal session:

```bash
export BERACHAIN_ARTIO_RPC="https://rpc.ankr.com/berachain_testnet"
```

### Step 3 - Deploying to Berachain

Compile the smart contract:

```bash
# FROM: ./pyth-oracle

forge build;
```

Deploy the smart contract (you will be prompted for the keystore password you set earlier):

```bash
# FROM: ./pyth-oracle

forge create ./src/ConsumerContract.sol:ConsumerContract --rpc-url $BERACHAIN_ARTIO_RPC --account deployer
```

### Step 4 - Interacting with your Contract

Fetch the payload for `priceUpdateData` from the Pyth API & write to file:

```bash
# FROM: ./pyth-oracle

curl -s "https://hermes.pyth.network/v2/updates/price/latest?&ids\[\]=0xff61491a931112ddf1bd8147cd1b641375f79f5825126d665480874634fd0ace" | sed -n 's/.*"data":\["\([^"]*\)"\].*/\1/p' > price_update.txt
```

Call `updatePrice` with the payload:

```bash
# FROM: ./pyth-oracle

cast send <YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT> --rpc-url $BERACHAIN_ARTIO_RPC "updatePrice(bytes[])"  "[0x`cat price_update.txt`]" --account deployer --value 0.0001ether
```

Next, query the price with `getPrice()`:

```bash
cast call <YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT> --rpc-url $BERACHAIN_ARTIO_RPC "getPrice()"
```

Optionally, decode the hexadecimal output with `abi-decode`:

```bash
cast abi-decode "getPrice()(int64,uint64,int32,uint)"  <YOUR_GETPRICE_OUTPUT>
```

### Troubleshooting

- If you don't act quick enough, you may encounter the error `0x19abf40e` representing a `StalePrice` error. This means that the `price_update.txt` was too old to be used by the contract. Re-run the sequence of commands in Step 4 to retry.
- The error code `0x025dbdd4` represents an `InsufficientFee` error. Try raising the value of $BERA in the `updatePrice` call e.g. `0.0005ether`.
